# Weather Dashboard

## The one stop shop for all your daily/weekly weather needs
This site utilizes OWM API in order to show current and up to date weather information for today and up to 6 days in the future.
The site allows users to search any city and will show them the current temperature, humidity, wind speed and uv index. It will
also show the forecast for the next 5 days including temperature and humidity as well as an icon to represent cloud coverage status.

### NOTE: for some reason the site at the deployed link won't work due to a mixed content/insecure resource but I swear it works 
opening it just through vscode. Any advice would be appreciated.
